## APIs are developed in NodeJS Express server and MongoDB.
###### Time spent 4 hours
###### Test cases are added to verify the code.
**RUN** npm test to run all tests

## GET '/films' to get all films
## GET '/film/:id' to get film by id
## POST '/film/' add new film
## POST '/user/register/' register a user with username and password
## POST '/film/comment' to comment on a film

###### I have used MongoDB as a database with MongoDB connection url already in the code. Sample movies data set is already on the cloud db.
